# November 2025 Breaking Changes

**Date**: November 9, 2025  
**Severity**: Medium (requires manual re-enablement of auto-posting)

## Summary

Two major changes to improve consistency and prevent unexpected auto-posting:

1. **All auto-posting now defaults to DISABLED**
2. **Legacy SecurityNews system removed**

## Breaking Change 1: Auto-Posting Defaults to Disabled

### What Changed

Previously, XKCD and Comics auto-posting defaulted to **enabled**, meaning setting a channel ID in `.env` would immediately start auto-posting. This was inconsistent with the News System (which defaulted to disabled) and could cause surprise posts.

**Now all auto-posting features default to DISABLED across the board.**

### Impact

| Feature | Old Behavior | New Behavior |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| XKCD | Set channel → auto-posts immediately | Set channel → must run `!xkcd_enable` |
| Comics | Set channel → auto-posts immediately | Set channel → must run `!comic_enable` |
| Solar | Set channel → must enable | ✅ No change (already disabled by default) |
| News (all) | Set channel → must enable | ✅ No change (already disabled by default) |

### Who Is Affected

**You ARE affected if:**
- You currently have `XKCD_POST_CHANNEL_ID` or `COMIC_POST_CHANNEL_ID` set in .env
- Your bot is currently auto-posting XKCD or comics
- You expect auto-posting to continue without intervention

**You are NOT affected if:**
- You use the News System only (already disabled by default)
- You configure channels via Discord commands after bot startup
- You're doing a fresh installation

### Migration Steps

If you currently have auto-posting enabled and want to keep it:

#### Option 1: Via Discord Commands (Recommended)

After deploying the update:

```
# XKCD
!xkcd_status
!xkcd_enable

# Comics
!comic_status
!comic_enable

# Solar (if applicable)
!solar_status
!solar_enable

# News System (if applicable)
/news status
/news enable cybersecurity
/news enable tech
# ... etc for each category
```

#### Option 2: Manual State File Edit (Advanced)

If the bot is stopped, you can manually edit state files:

```bash
cd /home/chiefgyk3d/src/penguin-overlord/penguin-overlord/data

# XKCD
nano xkcd_state.json
# Change "enabled": false to "enabled": true

# Comics
nano comic_state.json
# Change "enabled": false to "enabled": true

# Solar
nano solar_state.json
# Change "enabled": false to "enabled": true
```

### Code Changes

**File**: `penguin-overlord/cogs/xkcd_poster.py`
```python
# Line 53, 55 changed from:
self.state = {'last_posted': 0, 'channel_id': None, 'enabled': True}

# To:
self.state = {'last_posted': 0, 'channel_id': None, 'enabled': False}
```

**File**: `penguin-overlord/cogs/comics.py`
```python
# Line 65, 67 changed from:
self.state = {'last_posted': None, 'channel_id': None, 'enabled': True, 'source': 'random'}

# To:
self.state = {'last_posted': None, 'channel_id': None, 'enabled': False, 'source': 'random'}
```

### Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to temporarily revert to the old behavior:

```bash
cd /home/chiefgyk3d/src/penguin-overlord
git diff penguin-overlord/cogs/xkcd_poster.py
git diff penguin-overlord/cogs/comics.py

# To revert:
git checkout HEAD~1 -- penguin-overlord/cogs/xkcd_poster.py
git checkout HEAD~1 -- penguin-overlord/cogs/comics.py
```

## Breaking Change 2: Legacy SecurityNews Removed

### What Changed

The old `securitynews.py` cog (25 mixed-quality sources) has been **removed** and replaced by the modern `cybersecurity_news.py` (18 curated sources) which is part of the News System.

### Impact

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| `securitynews.py` cog | ❌ Removed (renamed to `.deprecated`) |
| `!secnews_*` commands | ❌ No longer available |
| `SECNEWS_POST_CHANNEL_ID` env var | ❌ No longer used |
| `data/securitynews_state.json` | ❌ Ignored (can be deleted) |
| `cybersecurity_news.py` cog | ✅ Modern replacement |
| `/news` commands | ✅ Use instead |
| `NEWS_CYBERSECURITY_CHANNEL_ID` | ✅ Use instead |

### Who Is Affected

**You ARE affected if:**
- You have `SECNEWS_POST_CHANNEL_ID` in your .env
- You use `!secnews_*` commands
- You rely on the old security news feeds

**You are NOT affected if:**
- You already use the News System (`NEWS_CYBERSECURITY_CHANNEL_ID`)
- You're doing a fresh installation
- You don't use security news features

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Switch to News System

**Old Configuration:**
```bash
# .env
SECNEWS_POST_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# Discord
!secnews_set_channel #security
!secnews_enable
!secnews_status
```

**New Configuration:**
```bash
# .env
NEWS_CYBERSECURITY_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678

# Discord
/news set_channel cybersecurity #security
/news enable cybersecurity
/news status
```

#### Step 2: Test New System

```
# Check sources
/news list_sources cybersecurity

# Toggle individual sources if needed
/news toggle_source cybersecurity krebs

# Fetch news manually to test
/news fetch cybersecurity
```

#### Step 3: Cleanup (Optional)

```bash
cd /home/chiefgyk3d/src/penguin-overlord

# Remove env var from .env (if present)
nano .env
# Delete line: SECNEWS_POST_CHANNEL_ID=...

# Remove old state file
rm penguin-overlord/data/securitynews_state.json

# Optionally remove deprecated cog entirely
rm penguin-overlord/cogs/securitynews.py.deprecated
```

### Advantages of New System

The new cybersecurity news category provides:

✅ **Better sources**: 18 curated high-quality feeds vs 25 mixed quality  
✅ **Per-source control**: Enable/disable individual sources  
✅ **Unified interface**: Same commands as all other news categories  
✅ **Better performance**: ETag caching, concurrent fetching, optimized intervals  
✅ **Date filtering**: Prevents spam from historical items  
✅ **Consistent behavior**: Same disabled-by-default policy  

### Sources Comparison

**Old SecurityNews** (25 sources, removed):
- Mixed quality, some duplicates
- No per-source control
- Separate management interface

**New Cybersecurity News** (18 sources, current):
1. 404 Media
2. Ars Technica Security
3. Bleeping Computer
4. CyberScoop
5. Dark Reading
6. Graham Cluley
7. Infosecurity Magazine
8. Kaspersky Securelist
9. Krebs on Security

### Rollback (If Needed)

If you absolutely need the old system temporarily:

```bash
cd /home/chiefgyk3d/src/penguin-overlord/penguin-overlord/cogs
mv securitynews.py.deprecated securitynews.py

# Restart bot
sudo systemctl restart penguin-overlord
```

**⚠️ Warning**: The old system will be completely removed in a future release. Migrate to the News System as soon as possible.
