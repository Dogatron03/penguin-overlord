## 🚀 Ready for Production

### What's Working:
1. ✅ All 73 news sources organized into 5 categories
2. ✅ ETag/Last-Modified caching implemented
3. ✅ GUID deduplication (last 50 per feed)
4. ✅ Concurrent fetching with rate limiting
5. ✅ Standalone one-shot execution model
6. ✅ Systemd timer deployment ready
7. ✅ Resource limits configured
8. ✅ Staggered intervals to distribute load

### Next Steps for Production:

#### 1. Configure Discord Channels (via Discord bot):
```
/news set_channel cybersecurity #security-news
/news set_channel tech #tech-news
/news set_channel gaming #gaming-news
/news set_channel apple_google #apple-google-news
/news set_channel cve #security-alerts
```

#### 2. Enable Auto-Posting:
```
/news enable cybersecurity
/news enable tech
/news enable gaming
/news enable apple_google
/news enable cve
```

#### 3. Deploy Systemd Timers (optional, for optimization):
```bash
sudo ./scripts/deploy-news-timers.sh
```

#### 4. Monitor (if using timers):
```bash
# Check timer status
systemctl list-timers penguin-news-*

# View logs
journalctl -u penguin-news-cybersecurity -f
```
