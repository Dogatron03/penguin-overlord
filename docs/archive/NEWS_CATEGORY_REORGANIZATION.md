# News Category Reorganization - November 9, 2025

## Summary

Reorganized news feeds into proper categories, removing general news feeds from US Legislation and creating a dedicated General News category.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed from US Legislation

The following feeds were **incorrectly placed** in US Legislation and have been moved:

- ❌ NPR News
- ❌ PBS NewsHour - Economy
- ❌ Pew Research Center
- ❌ New York Times - Homepage
- ❌ Foreign Affairs
- ❌ Politico

**Reason:** These are general news outlets, not government legislative sources.

### 2. US Legislation - Final Sources (5)

Now contains **only government legislative sources:**

| Source | Type | URL Status |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Bills Presented to President | Congress.gov | ✅ 200 |
| House Floor Today | Congress.gov | ✅ 200 |
| Senate Floor Today | Congress.gov | ✅ 200 |
| Most Viewed Bills | Congress.gov | ✅ 200 |
| GovInfo Bills | GovInfo.gov | ✅ 200 |

**Update Frequency:** Hourly at :05 minutes

### 3. New Category: General News (7 sources)

Created new dedicated category for general news outlets:

| Source | Emoji | URL | Status |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| NPR News | 📻 | feeds.npr.org | ✅ 200 |
| PBS NewsHour Economy | 📺 | pbs.org/newshour | ✅ 200 |
| Financial Times | 💼 | ft.com/news-feed | ✅ 200 |
| Pew Research Center | 📊 | pewresearch.org | ✅ 200 |
| New York Times | 📰 | nytimes.com | ✅ 200 |
| Foreign Affairs | 🌍 | foreignaffairs.com | ✅ 200 |
| Politico | 🏛️ | politico.com | ✅ 200 |

**Update Frequency:** Every 2 hours at :20 minutes
**Discord Command:** `/generalnews <source>`

**Note:** Financial Times feed corrected to proper URL: `https://www.ft.com/news-feed?format=rss`

## Current Category Structure

1. **Cybersecurity** - 18 sources, every 3 hours at :01

## Proper Categorization

### Why This Matters

**Before (Incorrect):**
- US Legislation mixed government sources with news outlets
- Confusing for users (is it official or news?)
- Hourly updates for general news (too frequent)

**After (Correct):**
- US Legislation = Government sources only (Congress.gov, GovInfo)
- General News = News outlets (NPR, NYT, etc.)
- Proper update frequencies (legislation: hourly, news: 2 hours)
- Clear separation of official vs. editorial content

### Benefits

1. **Clearer User Experience**
   - Users know what to expect from each channel
   - Official legislation vs. news coverage separated

2. **Better Update Scheduling**
   - Legislation updates hourly (time-sensitive)
   - General news updates every 2 hours (reasonable pace)

3. **Easier Management**
   - Enable/disable categories independently
   - Configure different channels for different content types

4. **Scalability**
   - Easy to add more news outlets to general_news
   - US Legislation stays focused on government sources

---

## Update Schedule Optimization

### Staggered Updates (Prevent Overlaps)

```
Hour 00: CVE (:00)
Hour 01: Cybersecurity (:01)
Hour 15: Gaming (:15)
Hour 20: General News (:20)     ✨ NEW
Hour 30: Tech (:30)
Hour 45: Apple/Google (:45)

Every Hour:
  :05 - US Legislation
  :10 - EU Legislation
```

**No conflicts!** All categories run at different times.

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Update news_config.json** (if it exists):
   ```bash
   # The bot will auto-create the category on first run
   # Or manually add:
   {
     "general_news": {
       "enabled": false,
       "channel_id": null,
       "interval_hours": 2,
       "minute_offset": 20,
       "sources": {},
       "approved_roles": [],
       "concurrency_limit": 5,
       "use_etag_cache": true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure in Discord**:
   ```
   /news set_channel general_news #general-news
   /news enable general_news
   ```

3. **Or use environment variable**:
   ```bash
   # .env
   NEWS_GENERAL_NEWS_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id
   ```

### Short Term (24 hours)

1. **Monitor first posts**:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u penguin-news-general_news -f
   ```

2. **Verify proper categorization**:
   - US Legislation channel should only have government sources
   - General News channel should have news outlets

3. **Check update timing**:
   - General news should post every 2 hours at :20
   - Should not conflict with other categories

### Long Term (1 week)

1. **Evaluate source quality**:
   - Are all 7 sources posting relevant content?
   - Any sources too noisy or redundant?

2. **Consider adjustments**:
   - Add more general news sources if needed
   - Adjust update frequency (2 hours may be too frequent/infrequent)

3. **User feedback**:
   - Are users finding the general news useful?
   - Should we split into sub-categories (politics, economics, world news)?

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Disable Category
```
/news disable general_news
```

### Remove from Config
```bash
# Remove from data/news_config.json
# Or delete the file to regenerate defaults
```

### Revert Code
```bash
git log --oneline | head -5
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Documentation Updates Needed

### Files to Update

1. **`docs/LEGISLATION_TRACKING.md`**
   - Remove references to news sources in US Legislation
   - Update source count to 5

2. **`docs/RSS_FEEDS_AND_API_KEYS.md`**
   - Add General News section
   - Update US Legislation to 5 sources
   - Update total source count to 90

3. **`docs/LEGISLATION_FEED_UPDATES.md`**
   - Mark as superseded by this document
