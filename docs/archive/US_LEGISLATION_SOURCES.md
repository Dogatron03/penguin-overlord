```

## Hourly Update Schedule

- **Frequency**: Every hour
- **Minute Offset**: :05 (e.g., 00:05, 01:05, 02:05...)
- **Prevents overlap** with news categories

## Expected Behavior

### During Congressional Sessions
- House/Senate floor feeds will have items about current proceedings
- Bills presented to president will show pending legislation
- Most viewed will reflect hot topics

### During Recess
- Floor feeds may be empty (normal)
- Bills presented may be empty (normal)
- GovInfo continues with historical/archived content
- Most viewed still shows popular bills

## Feed Characteristics

| Source | Update Frequency | Volume | Empty When? |
|--------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| Presented to President | Real-time | Low | Often (only when bills pending signature) |
| House Floor | Real-time | Low | When House not in session |
| Senate Floor | Real-time | Low | When Senate not in session |
| Most Viewed | Daily | Low | Rarely |
| GovInfo Bills | Daily | **High** (100+) | Never |

**⚠️ Warning**: GovInfo Bills feed is very high volume (100 items). Consider:
- Disabling by default: `/news toggle_source us_legislation govinfo_bills`
- Or increasing deduplication cache size
- Posts will flood channel if all 100 items are new

## Recommendation

For most use cases, you may want to disable `govinfo_bills` initially:

```
/news toggle_source us_legislation govinfo_bills
```

This leaves you with 4 low-volume, high-signal sources focused on active congressional activity.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all feeds:
```bash
python3 scripts/test_us_legislation.py

Expected output: All 5 feeds should show ✅ OK
